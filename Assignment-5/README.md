# Multimodal Image Captioning

## 1. Introduction
This report outlines the implementation of a multimodal image captioning system. The assignment's primary objective was to demonstrate how a transformer-based model can generate descriptive text captions for images, showcasing the integration of vision and language modalities.

## 2. Model Used
The core of the image captioning system is a BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model, specifically implemented using `BlipProcessor` and `BlipForConditionalGeneration` from the Hugging Face Transformers library. BLIP is a powerful multimodal model capable of understanding both images and text, making it suitable for tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and image-text retrieval.

## 3. Process Pipeline
The image captioning process follows a clear pipeline:

- **Image Loading:** Images are loaded either from a local file path using the PIL (Pillow) library or fetched from a URL using the requests library. This step ensures that the image data is in a format suitable for processing.

- **Preprocessing (Processor):** Once an image is loaded, it is fed into the `BlipProcessor`. This processor is responsible for preparing both the image and (if applicable) text for the BLIP model. For image captioning, it handles necessary image transformations (e.g., resizing, normalization) and tokenization, converting the image into a numerical format that the model can interpret.

- **Caption Generation:** The preprocessed image inputs are then passed to the `BlipForConditionalGeneration` model. The model analyzes the visual features of the image and generates a textual description (caption). The `decode` method of the processor is then used to convert the model's output tokens back into a human-readable string.

## 4. Example Scenario
A practical demonstration involved generating a caption for a local image file named `coffee.jpeg`.

- **Input Image:** A JPEG image of coffee.
- **Generated Caption:** "a large coffee cup"

This example effectively illustrates the model's ability to accurately describe the content of an image.

## 5. Conclusion
This assignment successfully implemented a multimodal image captioning system utilizing the BLIP transformer model. The project demonstrated the complete pipeline from image input and preprocessing to the generation of descriptive captions, highlighting the capabilities of advanced multimodal AI models in bridging the gap between visual and textual data.
