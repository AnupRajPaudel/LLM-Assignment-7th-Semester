## Project Overview: A Comprehensive NLP Pipeline

This project details the development and implementation of a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline, designed to demonstrate key stages of text analysis and understanding. The pipeline integrates the following core functionalities:

-   **Text Preprocessing Module:** Features custom-built tools for efficient text cleaning and preparation, accessible via an intuitive web interface for hands-on text manipulation.

-   **Word Embedding Analysis:** Explores vector representations of words, offering an interactive visualization component to delve into semantic relationships and patterns.

-   **Text Summarization Engine:** Employs an LSTM-based approach to generate concise text summaries, showcased through a real-time demonstration for immediate application.

## Technical Implementation Details

The project is engineered for both functionality and user interaction, incorporating:

-   **RESTful API Endpoints:** Each core component of the NLP pipeline is exposed through dedicated RESTful API endpoints, ensuring flexibility and ease of integration.

-   **Interactive Web Application:** A dedicated web application provides a user-friendly interface for direct interaction with and exploration of the implemented NLP features.

-   **Visualization Tools:** Integrated visualization capabilities offer clear insights into the underlying model behaviors and the impact of the processing steps.
